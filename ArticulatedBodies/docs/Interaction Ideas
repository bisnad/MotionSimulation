Interaction Ideas

Simulated Arms

Multi-Arms and Light Control:
Proximity-based interaction: those lights that are closer than a distance threshold to Muriel become active, there can also be a number limit on how many lights can become active at the same time, the quality chosen by the lights is either predetermined or random

Single-Arm and Light Control:
One or two joints of Muriel are mapped on one or two joints of a multi-segmented single arm. The arm's other joints are controlled by a quality that is either predetermined or randomly chosen.

Multi-Arm and Laser Control:
